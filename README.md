# Laptop-Configuration-And-Price-Analysis
This repo will guide you through the basic analysis and the prediction in the laptop price and other configuration.

* What the project is about?

The main objective of this project is to handle, explore, analyze the laptop price data data and predict the price of the laptop by using other configurations of the laptop. The problem statement is copied directly from Kaggle.

Laptop is very necessary to work in many field smoothly. Laptop pricing gets harder at scale.

There are huge number of company who make laptop and everyday they try to update it’s configuration.

* What is the task?

The task is see the accuracy of the price on behalf of laptop configuration and guess the laptop price. Here other configuration analysis are also done how they effect each other. 

* What action did I take?

To predict the price, I had to tackle the problem following the standard data science pipelines. I cleaned the noisy data, analyze them, visualized the distribution when necessary.
I need to make relations among configurations to analysis relation between them and how they effect each other.
